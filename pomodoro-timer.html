            <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
            <p>The Pomodoro Technique is a way to manage focus time for better performance. The user has to choose a task to focus on for a set period of time, and once that time has finished, then the user can take a small break or a long break depending on how my sessions the user has done (usually after 4 pomodoros focus sessions).</p>

            <p>Pomodoro Timer GUI Python Vers. is a recreation of my Pomodro Timer GUI Java Vers. Since I have had some experience creating Swing GUIs using Java, I wanted to compare the differences between these languages. For the most part the framework I've chosen (DearPyGUI) and the Swing framework were entirely different. For example instead of actionListeners, we'd have to reference a callback method for the buttons. Also, we can generate multiple windows within one frame to appear at once with DearPyGUI. And above else I found it easier to create the GUI that I wanted with DearPyGUI as opposed to Swing. </p>

            <p>The reason why I chose DearPyGUI over other frameworks like Tkinter, QT, or Kivy is that it is open-source, I don't need to worry about the terms and conditions especially for a small project like this, and it has a very active community (Discord and Reddit).</p>

            <br>
            <p><strong>Technologies and Frameworks</strong></p>
   
            <p> PyCharm IDE - The environment used to code in Python </p>
            <p> DearPyGUI Framework - Framework used to create the GUI for this project</p>
            <p> Playsound Module - Imported the playsound module so that I could alert the user that their session was done</p>
            <p> Python 3.9 </p>

            
            <br>
            <p><strong>Demonstration & How to Use</strong></p>
            <p> Make sure to install the DearPyGUI and Playsound Modules for it to work. You can follow the installation to DearPyGUI <a href="https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui">           here </a>, and install Playsound <a href="https://pypi.org/project/playsound/"> here </a>.</p> 
            <p> You could always just do <i> pip install dearpygui </i> and <i> pip install playsound. </i> </p>

            <p><strong>Configuring Settings</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Timer Buttons</strong></p>
            <p>Pause - Pauses the timer</p>
            <p>Stop - Stops the timer, and returns user back to the setting configurations
            </p>
            <p>Restart - Resets the timer to the original timer and the Pomodoro Counter
            </p>
            <p>Resume - (only available once the user pauses the timer) Resumes the timer
            </p>

            <p><strong>What happens when the Timer finishes</strong></p>
            <p>Once the timer finishes, a small dialog appears that asks the user either to continue with focusing or take a break. Also by default, if the user closes the dialog, it will start another focus session. Note that the user can not give focus to other things while the dialog is still open.</p>

            <br>
            <p>After 4 pomodoro sessions, the small break button will be replaced with a long break button.</p>

            <br>
            <p><strong>What I Learned </strong></p>  
            <p>When using a new framework like this, it is important to visit their communities (i.e. Discord and Reddit) for help as usually problems don't appear often in popular sites like stackoverflow</p>
            <p>Python has a more cleaner way of setting up a GUI as opposed to in Java.
            </p>
            <p>Since threading was involved in counting down the timer and updating the GUI, I had to make them into daemon threads which meant that once the main thread ends it ends the process almost immediately</p>
            <p>If I wanted a make a thread wait for another thread, I'd have to use the join()
            </p>
